  quick question at the end of the submission process. Your decision to participate is completely voluntary and will
  only briefly add to the time needed to complete your submission. Your decision not to participate will not impact your
  access to or use of the Permit Hub.&nbsp; Any information collected from you as a result of participation will be used
